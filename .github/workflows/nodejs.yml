# This workflow will do a clean install of node dependencies, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions
# It will also deploy the build to two different repos with https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
