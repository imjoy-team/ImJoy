# User Manual

Here we describe in more detail the main concepts of ImJoy and how it can
be used. 

## Glossary

-   **ImJoy app** - Interface running either in the browser or as a standalone app
    allowing to control ImJoy.
-   **Plugin** - Added functionality to ImJoy to either enhance the user interface
    or perform computational tasks. Plugins developed in Python require the Plugin Engine.
-   **Plugin Engine** - Python program to execute plugins in the background for heavy
    computations.
-   **Operators [ops]** - One plugin can allow to perform tasks with a set of
    operators ("ops"). These ops can be used in a workflow or accessed from the plugin menu.
-   **Workspace** - Isolated work environments with a distinct set of plugins.
    Allows to perform independent calculations.

## ImJoy App and Plugin Engine

ImJoy can be used  directly from your browser (Chrome or Firefox)
**without any installation** as the [ImJoy Web App](https://imjoy.io/#/app)
or as a **standalone** [ImJoy Desktop App](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-App/releases).
Many plugins can be used directly, and you can already get a feeling
for how ImJoy works.

For more advanced processing, the **Python Plugin Engine** is required. The Plugin
Engine allows to run native Python (`native-python`) plugins. We provide two ways
to obtain this engine:

1.  The plugin engine is included in the ImJoy Desktop App. After installing the
    [Desktop App](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-App/releases), you can start the engine
    with the button `START PLUGINE ENGINE`.

2. You can download and install it with a command line script as described [here](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-engine).

Once you start the engine, it will automatically check for updates.

You can then connect to the engine either from the Imjoy Web App or Desktop App.
Click the ðŸš€ symbol located at the top-right corner. This will open a dialog and
ask you for the `Plugin Engine URL` and `Connection token`.

![imjoy-install-engine](assets/imjoy-install-engine.png ':size=600')

You can keep the default `Plugin Engine URL`(`http://127.0.0.1:8080`), and go to
your Plugin Engine dialog or terminal window to get the `Connection token`.

![imjoy-connection-token](assets/imjoy-connection-token.png ':size=600')

Please note, that the connection token will be saved in the browser and you will
not need to enter it anymore to connect to this Plugin Engine.
**KEEP THIS TOKEN PRIVATE!!!!**

## Using ImJoy offline

The ImJoy app (web or desktop) requires by default internet access. It relies on
different small libraries that are downloaded at each launch. You can also use the ImJoy app in
an offline mode. In this case, all necessary files have to be downloaded first.

Note that even though ImJoy can run without internet, depending on particular
plugin implementations, some might be unusable when offline.

Two options for offline usage exist:

1. **Desktop app**. On the start-up screen you can choose `RUN IMJOY OFFLINE`. If
  you press this button, the app will download all necessary files required
  for offline use. After the initial download, you can then use ImJoy offline.

2. **Web app**. If you prefer to use ImJoy in the browser, you can download all
  necessary files via the plugin engine. For this, you need to install the latest
  version of the [**ImJoy App**](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Engine/releases).
  You can then serve the static ImJoy web app. This requires some simple steps in
  the  terminal:

  1. Update the `$PATH` settings as also [below](#access-the-plugin-engine-from-a-command-line-interface).
      ``` bash
      # linux and mac
      # export PATH=~/ImJoyApp/bin:$PATH

      # windows
      # $env:Path = '%systemdrive%%homepath%\ImJoyApp;%systemdrive%%homepath%\ImJoyApp\Scripts;' + $env:Path;
      ```
  0. Execute the following command in the terminal. This will download all files
     necessary for offline access.
      ``` bash
      python -m imjoy --serve
      ```
  0. You now have your locally available ImJoy web app that your can access in your browser
     with this url [(http://127.0.0.1:8080)](http://127.0.0.1:8080).


## Access the Plugin Engine from a command line interface
The installation of the Plugin Engine will setup an **Miniconda environment**
located in `~/ImJoyApp`. You can access this Miniconda environment from the
command line interface.

For **Linux or MacOS**, you need to add `~/ImJoyApp/bin` to your `$PATH`:
```
export PATH=~/ImJoyApp/bin:$PATH

# now you can use `conda`, `pip`, `python` provided from ~/ImJoyApp
which conda

# start the plugin engine
python -m imjoy

```

For **Windows**, you can use a powershell and add the ImJoyApp to `$env.Path`:
```
$env:Path = '%systemdrive%%homepath%\ImJoyApp;%systemdrive%%homepath%\ImJoyApp\Scripts;' + $env:Path;

# now you can use `conda`, `pip`, `python` provided from ~/ImJoyApp
(Get-Command conda.exe).Path

# start the plugin engine
python -m imjoy
```





## Using the Plugin Engine remotely
To perform computational intensive calculations you can launch the Plugin Engine
remotely, e.g. on dedicated processing workstations, computational clusters, or
the cloud. Please note that the [**ImJoy token system**](#plugin-engine) prevent
unauthorized access.

Installing and connecting to such a remote Plugin engine can
be achieved in a few steps. You first install the plugin engine and configure it
for command line access as [describe above](#access-the-plugin-engine-from-a-command-line-interface).
You can launch the Plugin Engine from a terminal (e.g. by `ssh`) and specify the
host to allow outside connections. In order to connect to the Plugin Engine,
you will need the **connection token** and the `hostname` or the IP address
of your remote machine. Depending on your IT security restrictions,
you might need to contact your IT department.


1. Install Python plugin engine on the remote computer. If this remote machine is
  running under Linux, you can connect with SSH, and run a provided installation
  script: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oeway/ImJoy-Engine/master/utils/Linux_Install.sh  -O - | bash`.
  Otherwise, download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-App/releases).

0. Update the `$PATH` settings as explained [above](#launch-the-plugin-engine-on-remote-machine).
  For Linux or Mac, use `export PATH=~/ImJoyApp/bin:$PATH`

0. Launch Python plugin engine on remote computer and allow access. We recommend
  to login the remote server with SSH, start the plugin engine with `python -m imjoy --serve --host=0.0.0.0`.
  By default, the host is to `127.0.0.1`, which allows only local connections. For remote access, the host is set to `0.0.0.0`.
  The plugin engine will be launched and serve a copy of the ImJoy app through `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:8080`.
  At the end of the initialization process, it will display the **connection token**.
  Copy it from the terminal, since you will need it in the next step. **KEEP THIS TOKEN PRIVATE!!!!**

0. On your local machine, use your web browser to access the ImJoy app on the remote machine
  with `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:8080` (instead of `https://imjoy.io` ). Then connect
  to the plugin engine by using `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:8080` as host and
  the **connection token** you get when you start the engine.

## FAQs

### Plugin engine doesn't start (anymore)
When the plugin engine doesn't start, performing an ImJoy upgrade often resolves this
problem. For this, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```python
export PATH=~/ImJoyApp/bin:$PATH
pip install -U git+https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Engine#egg=imjoy
```

### Use existing Python
This depends whether it's a conda-compatible distribution or not. Try to type `conda -V` command, if you see a version number(e.g:`conda 4.3.30`), it means you can skip the Anaconda/Miniconda installation, and install ImJoy directly with your existing Python.

### Using ImJoy with Python 2.7 or version <3.6
Yes, if you the conda environment exists. You will be able to install and run ImJoy with Python version lower thant 3.6 (e.g.: Anaconda/Miniconda Python2.7). However, in this case, it will bootstrapping itself by creating a Python 3 environment (named `imjoy`) in order to run the actual plugin engine code. Therefore, Anaconda/Miniconda (Python3.6+ version) is still recommended if you have the choice.

### Can't connect to plugin engine running on a remote computer

First, you needs to make sure the other computer with plugin engine can be
accessed from your current network and is no blocked, e.g. by a firewall.

Second, currently you can't use ImJoy.io loaded with `https` with the Plugin Engine,
because modern browsers do not allow you to make a insecure connection within a SSL
secured website. So, you will have to switch to the offline version.

Currently, the recommended way to use ImJoy on a remote computer:
 1. Login the remote server with SSH, start the plugin engine with
    `python -m imjoy --serve --host=0.0.0.0`. The plugin engine will
    download a copy of ImJoy app and serve it through `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:8080`.
    In the meantime, it will give your a **connection token**, copy it from the
    terminal and you will need it in the next step.

 2. Use your web browser to access `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:8080`
    (instead of `https://imjoy.io` ), then you can connect to the plugin engine
    by using `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:8080` as host and the **connection token** you
    get when you start the engine.

Also notice that, the ImJoy web app served from your plugin engine are completely isolated from the one from https://imjoy.io, meaning that the installed plugins, data are not shared.

### Plugin engine error "address already in use"
If you see something like this: `OSError: [Errno 48] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8080): address already in use`, It means you have another instance running which uses the port needed by the Plugin Engine. You need to find this instance  and kill that task if you don't known which one. For example, for port `8080`, you can run `lsof -n -i :8080 | grep LISTEN` in a terminal. This will list all process listening to the `8080` port, e.g. `+python3.6 1095 fmueller    7u  IPv4 0xb4b82ae29cbba843      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:http-alt (LISTEN)`. The process ID can be found directly after `python3.6`, in this case `1095`, you can then kill this process with `kill 1095`.

### CommandNotFoundError with 'conda activate'
By default, ImJoy uses `conda activate` to activate conda environments if it's available. However, you may need to setup `conda activate` according to here: https://github.com/conda/conda/releases/tag/4.4.0
