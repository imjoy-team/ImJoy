# Developing Plugins for ImJoy

## Overview

Developing plugins for ImJoy is easy and fast with the built-in code editor which runs directly in the web app, no additional IDE or compiler is needed for development.

The following list illustrates key features of the plugin system in ImJoy:
 * Support Python and JavaScript
   - JavaScript plugins are isolated with secured sandboxes
   - Python plugins run in their own process
   - Support concurrent API calls using `async/await` syntax
   - Support virtual environments and pip packages for Python
   - Support libraries hosted on GitHub or CDNs for JavaScript
 * Native support for n-dimensional arrays and tensors
   - Support ndarrays from Numpy or Numjs for data exchange
   - Support Tensorflow.js and native Tensorflow for deep learning
 * Rendering multi-dimensional data in 3D with webGL, Three.js etc.
 * Deploying your own plugin with GitHub


### ImJoy architecture
Imjoy consists of **two main components**

 1.  The **ImJoy Web App**. The core part of ImJoy which runs in the browser across different OS and devices. It provides a flexible plugin system with workflow and window management. Plugins can be developed in different programming languages including JavaScript and Python. Plugins with their source code can be organized into workspaces and stored in the browser database. Web plugins are running in an `iframe` or `webworker`, therefore developers can in principle use any frontend framework or javascript library independently for each plugin.

 2.  Optionally, the **Plugin Engine** for running computational tasks in CPython to taking advantage of the power of native hardware (e.g. GPU) and software libraries (e.g.: numpy, Tensorflow, PyTorch etc.). Under the hood, it's a python package ([GitHub](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-engine)) runs in the background and connect to the ImJoy Web App through websocket. It uses [conda](https://conda.io/) to manage software packages (not only Python, but also C++, Java etc.) and virtual environments. Developers can then add `conda` or `pypi` packages as requirements to the plugin, and they can be automatically resolved by the plugin engine. Similarly, developers can use any Python library or even non-python library in Python plugins.

 The Plugin Engine is connected with the ImJoy Web App through websockets,
 and communicates with a customised remote procedure calls (RPC) based on [socket.io](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio).

### ImJoy code editor and developer tools
ImJoy has full support for plugin developing and you write new plugins directly
in ImJoy with the built-in code editor. Together with the debugging tools provided by modern browsers (e.g.: Google Chrome Developer Tools; more details below), no extra IDE or tool is needed.

You can view and modify the plugin code for any existing plugin by clicking `Edit` from the plugin menu (the icon beside the plugin name).

![imjoy-code-editor](assets/imjoy-code-editor.jpg ':size=800')


### Getting Started
To make your first ImJoy plugin, you can click "+ PLUGINS", and choose one of the template from the "+ CREATE A NEW PLUGIN" dropdown menu.

![imjoy-plugin-types](assets/imjoy-plugin-types.png ':size=800')

For example, you can select "Default Template" to make your first ImJoy plugin. After selection, a code editor will open in the ImJoy workspace.

You can then write plugin code in Javascript, you can quick browse through the code. Without changing the code, if you just save it by clicking the save icon, a new entry called "Untiled Plugin" will be added to the plugin menu.

To run your plugin, you can click on the "Untitled Plugin" button.

If everything goes well, you will see a popup dialog with "Hello World".

![imjoy-hello-world](assets/imjoy-hello-world.jpg ':size=800')

Congratulations! You just made your first ImJoy plugin.

Feel free to modify the code, save and run again. To understand more, please proceed further.

If you are new to web development (Javascript, HTML, CSS etc.), you may want to take a look at a few tutorials on [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/).

Specifically, we recommend to go through the following tutorials:
 * [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) for adding elements such as text box and buttons to the web user interface;
 * [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) for changing the visual style of HTML elements;
 * [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) for operating the HTML/CSS, perform logic code and computation;
 * [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp) is a format we used to configure plugins.
 * [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) for perform computation tasks.

An important programming style you are going to use heavily in ImJoy plugin development is Asynchronous Programming. It is a way to achieve concurency (alternative to `Processes` and `Threads`), such that you can perform mulitple operations(e.g. run independent steps in a workflow) concurrently. For more information about Asynchronous programming, we refer to a number of excellent ressources:

* [Introduction to Promise in JS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises)
* [Async functions for JS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions)
* [Async programming in Python](http://maked.io/async-programming-in-python/)

### Debugging
During plugin development, errors and related information will be forwarded
and shown in the status bar or as message in the snackbar.

Modern browsers are often come with built-in developer tools, for example, [Chrome developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) provides different tools for debugging HTML/CSS/Javascript, network and others. It is recommended to use it for debugging web plugins. For example, you can use `console.log()`, `console.error()` etc. in JavaScript as usual, then inspect the logs and errors in the browser console. In Python plugins, the error trackback will also be forwarded to the browser console.

![chrome-developer-tools](assets/chrome-developer-tools.jpg ':size=800')

In addition to that, you can also use ImJoy API functions including `api.log()`, `api.error()`, `api.alert()`, `api.showMessage()` to show message to ImJoy app.

Specifically for Python plugin, `print()` will only be seen in the terminal where you launch the plugin engine, thus API functions are recommended for Python plugins.

## Plugin types and configurations

 ImJoy provides a flexible framework to develop your plugins with different types in web or Python programming language.

![imjoy-plugin-development](assets/imjoy-plugin-development.png ':size=800')

There are four types of plugins available for different purposes:

**Web** plugins runs directly in the browser, these three types are supported:

1. **Window (HTML/CSS/JS)**(type=`window`) plugins for building a rich and interactive user interface using HTML5/CSS and JavaScript;

1. **Web Worker (JS)**(type=`web-worker`) plugins for performing computational tasks using JavaScript or WebAssembly;

1. **Web Python**(type=`web-python`) plugins for performing computational tasks using Python with in the browser through WebAssembly and the [pyodide project](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide).
   Such plugins are indicated with a little snake üêç. This is in developmental stage and only a selected number of Python libraries are currently supported.

**Native** plugins runs in the plugin engine, we currently support:

1. **Native Python**(type=`native-python`) plugins for performing heavy-duty computational tasks using Python and its libraries, this requires additional installation of plugin engine.
   These plugins are indicated with a rocket üöÄ;


Plugin templates for each plugin types can be accessed by clicking the **+ PLUGINS** button, then select one of the plugin template from the `Create a New Plugin` dropdown menu.

### Web Worker
These plugins are used to do computation tasks in another thread,
using a new element called [web worker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker).
It does not have an interface, it runs in a new thread and won't hang the main thread during running.
It is basically a way for JavaScript to achieve multi-threading.

Since web workers are designed to perform computational tasks,
they do not have access to [html dom](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp)
 but you can use `ImJoy API` to interact with the graphical interface of ImJoy
 or other plugin which can trigger changes in the user interface.

### Window
Window plugins are used to create a new web interface with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
They are created in an `iframe` mode, and they will show up as a window. The `<window>` and `<style>`
blocks (see below) can be used to define the actual content of the window.

Different from other plugins which will be loaded and initialised when ImJoy is started,
a `window` plugin will not be loaded until the actual plugin is created with `api.createWindow` or clicked on by a user in the menu. During execution of `api.createWindow`, `setup` and `run` will be called for the first time, and return with an window api object (contains all the api functions of the window, including `setup`, `run` and other functions if defined). You can then use the window api object to access all the functions, for example, update the content of the window by `win_obj.run({'data': ... })`.


### Web Python
Running python code and scientific libraries entirely in the browser. ImJoy uses [pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/) to run python plugins, it supports running Python3 code with scientific libraries (including numpy, scipy, scikit-learn etc.) through WebAssembly.


### Native Python
Used to run native Python code to fully access your hardware (e.g. GPU, NVLINK ) and software (e.g. CUDA and CUDNN) enviroments. This requires that the **Python Plugin Engine** is installed and started before using the plugin. See the **Developing Python Plugins** for more details.

Similarly to Web Worker plugins, Native Python plugins do not have access to the html dom, but you can use `ImJoy API` to interact with the graphical interface of ImJoy or other plugin which can trigger changes on the user interface.


### ImJoy App and Plugin Engine

The recommended way to use the ImJoy App is through [https://imjoy.io](https://imjoy.io). A new way of running and using web applications called Progressive Web App (PWA) are increasingly supported by modern browsers such as Google Chrome.

In Chrome for example, user can install ImJoy into [chrome://apps/](chrome://apps/) and start from the ImJoy App dashboard. Once installed, ImJoy can then run in independent browser window (without the address bar). The core part of ImJoy also supports offline, but not yet for the plugins (will be supported).

You can run all the web plugins (`web-worker`, `window`, `web-python`) with the ImJoy App, however, for native plugins (`native-python`) you will need to connect to a plugin engine running locally or remotely.
Here are the two options for installing the plugine engine:

For running plugins with the plugin engine, please download and install Anaconda or Miniconda with Python3, then run `pip install imjoy`. The plugin engine can then be launched through the `imjoy --jupyter` command. More details are available [here](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-engine/).


## Plugin file format
The ImJoy plugin file format (shared by all Plugin types)  is built up on html format with customised blocks (inspired by the `.vue` format). It consists of two mandatory blocks `<config>` and `<script>`, and other optional blocks including `<docs>`, `<window>`,`<attachment>`,`<link>` and `<style>`.  For `<style>`, you can also set the `src` attribute.

Here is an a typical outline of such a plugin file. Note that the
order of these blocks does not matter, so you can shuffle the blocks.

```
<config lang="json">
   ** A code block in Json format describes the plugin**
</config>

<script lang="javascript">
   ** A code block in JavaScript or Python format**
</script>

<window lang="html">
   ** A code block in HTML format**
   (for plugins in `window` mode)
</window>

<style lang="css">
   ** A code block in CSS format**
   (for plugins in `window` mode)
</style>

<docs lang="markdown">
   ** A recommended code block in Markdown format with the documentation of the plugin **
</docs>

<attachment name="XXXXX">
   ** An optional block for storing text data, you can use multiple of them **
</attachment>
```


### `<config>` block
Defines the general properties of a plugin with several fields in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) or [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format which is more human readable.

Config in `json` format:
```html
<config lang="json">
{
  "name": "Untitled Plugin",
  "type": "web-worker",
  "tags": [],
  "ui": "image processing",
  "cover": "",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "api_version": "0.1.6",
  "description": "A plugin for image processing.",
  "icon": "extension",
  "inputs": null,
  "outputs": null,
  "env": null,
  "permissions": [],
  "requirements": [],
  "dependencies": []
}
</config>
```

Config in `yaml` format:
```html
<config lang="yaml">
name: Untitled Plugin
type: web-worker
tags: []
ui: image processing
cover: ''
version: 0.1.0
api_version: 0.1.6
description: A plugin for image processing.
icon: extension
inputs: 
outputs: 
env: 
permissions: []
requirements: []
dependencies: []
</config>
```

#### name
Name of the plugin. It **must** be unique to avoid conflicts with other plugins.

#### type
Plugin type.

Allowed are : `web-worker`, `window`, `native-python` and `web-python`.
See dedicated section [ImJoy Plugins](development?id=imjoy-plugins) for more details.

#### version
Specifies the version of the plugin.

#### api_version
Specifies the api version of ImJoy the plugin is written for.

#### url
Points to current file. It is used to download the plugin when a user installs it from the plugin repository.

#### description
Contains a short description of the plugin.

#### cover
An url to a cover image of the plugin, it will shown up in the image installation dialog, and also on top of the plugin documentation.

Example: `"cover":"https://imjoy.io/static/img/imjoy-card-plain.png"`.

The cover image is recommended to have a aspect ratio of 16:9.
It can be hosted inside the GitHub repo, in that case, a `raw` url to the image should be used.

Multiple images can be used, by set `cover` to an array: `"cover": ["url_to_image1", "url_to_image2", "url_to_image3"]`.

#### labels
Defines a list of `labels` to catagrize the plugin to allow searching or filtering based on the sematic labels.

#### authors
A list of the name of authors.

#### license
Name of the plugin license.

#### repository
URL for the plugin project repository

#### website
URL for the plugin project website

#### tags
List of supported tags which configures the plugin after installed. 

(Note: `tags` in ImJoy is not for classification or catagrization purposes, for that you can use `labels` instead.)

Such tags provide configureable modes for plugin execution,
e.g. if a plugin is run on a CPU or GPU. Tags can be accessed at various points in the plugin.
If a plugin was defined with tags, they will appear  on top of the code editor and during the installation process.
If you distribute your plugin with an [url](development?id=generating-a-plugin-url), you can specify
with which tag the plugin will be installed.

Within the **``<config>``** block, the following fields can be made configurable:
- `env`
- `requirements`
- `dependencies`
- `icon`
- `ui`
- `type`
- `flags`
- `cover`

**Example 1**: a python plugin should install different requirements depending if it will
be executed on GPU or CPU. You can then defined two tags: `"tags" : ["GPU", "CPU"]`.
You can set different `requirements` accordingly: `"requirements": {"GPU": ["tensorflow-gpu", "keras"], "CPU": ["tensorflow", "keras"]}`.
The user will be asked to choose one of the tags during the installation, which will then install
the specified requirements.

Besides the **``<config>``**, you can also configure the **`<script>`** block, and you can
select which script block will be executed. For this, you have to add the `tag` property
to the `<script>` block. Notice also that you will still need the `lang` property.

**Example 2**. You can switch between a stable and development version of a plugin.
If you have `"tags": ["stable", "dev"]`, then you can have two script blocks: `<script lang="python" tag="stable">` and `<script lang="python" tag="dev">`.
When developing and testing a plugin, the ImJoy editor will recognize that the plugin
has multiple tags and you can select a tag in the tile bar of the plugin. When loading
the plugin, it will be loaded with this tag.


#### ui
String specifying the plugin GUI that will be displayed just below the plugin.

**Input form**: the following elements can be used to render an input form:

* `type: 'choose', options: ['cat', 'dog'], placeholder: 'cat'`
* `type: 'number', min: 0, max: 10, placeholder:2`
* `type: 'color'`
* `type: 'string'`
* `type: 'save'`
* `type: 'instructions/comment'`
* `type: 'variableName'`
* ...

For each element, you need to define a unique `id`, which can then be used to **access
the value of this element in the plugin** with `ctx.config.id`.

For example, to render a form with a selection use `"ui": "select an option: {id: 'option1', type: 'choose', options: ['cat', 'dog'],     placeholder: 'cat'}"`. In the plugin, the selection can then be accessed with `ctx.config.option1`.

In some cases, the ui might only contain a brief description of the op.
This can either be plain text, or you can also specify a **link**    with `"ui": " <a href='https://imjoy.io' target='_blank'> ImJoy</a>"`. The `target='_blank'` will open this page in a new tab.


**HTML and CSS**: for better rendering of the interface, we support **certain html tags** in the ui string. Notice that HTML tags and CSS will be sanitized(details [here](api?id=sanitized-html-and-css)).


**Longer forms**: to define forms with multiple lines, we support additional definitions of the `ui` string.

* an array of strings. For example:
```javascript
"ui": [
   "option1: {id: 'option1', type: 'choose', options: ['cat', 'dog'], placeholder: 'cat'}",
   "option2: {id: 'option2', type: 'number', placeholder: 3}"
  ],
```
*   an array with keys and values. Here, you have to use `" "` for the keys and
    the strings. Definitions can also be mixed.

In the  example below, we use a string as above for `option1` and an array with keys and values for `option2`. Note how for `option2` each key and value is defined as an individual string.

 ```json
 "ui": [
  {"option1": "{id: 'option1', type: 'choose', options: ['cat', 'dog'], placeholder: 'cat'}"},
  {"option2": {"id": "option2",
               "type": "number",
               "placeholder": 3}}],
  ```

#### flags
Defines an array of flags which will be used by ImJoy to control the behaviour of the plugin.

One important flag is **`functional`**:

*  The **`functional`** flag indicates that all api functions exposed by the plugin
   are [pure functions](https://www.sitepoint.com/functional-programming-pure-functions/).
   This means that their output will only depend on the current inputs passed to the
   function, nothing else. Pure functions thus guarantee no side effect to the plugin
   after calling any of the plugin api functions. This means that you should avoid
   modifying global variables in the plugin functions with one exception which is the `setup()` function.
   Making a plugin `functional` makes debugging easier, and importantly other plugins or workflows calling
   only `functional` plugins will be strictly reproducible.
   Functional plugins are crucial for ImJoy to perform parallelisation and batch processing in the near future.

   We don't have a real test to verify whether a plugin is functional yet, so please
   add the `functional` flag only when you are sure your plugin contains only pure functions.


Further, we support `flags` for run-time control.

These flags allow to specify how ImJoy instances are handled by the Interface and the Plugin engine.
For more information we refer to the dedicated section on [plugin run time behaviour](development?id=controlling-run-time-behaviour-of-native-python-plugins).

* `single-instance` (**for python plugins only**). Python engine will only run a single plugin process even if
  plugin is called from different browsers or workspaces. In this case, the different ImJoy instances will share
  the same plugin process. This is especially useful when your plugin need to occupy limited resources such as GPU.

* `allow-detach` (**for python plugins only**). Allows the plugin process to detach from the user interface. This means
  the plugin will not be killed when the user interface is disconnected or closed. However, in order to reconnect to this process,
  you need to reconnect from the exact browser and same workspace, or add the `single-instance` flag.

Example: to make a plugin which can run without the user interface in the background and to which you can attach set
 `"flags": ["single-instance", "allow-detach"]`. The interface will automatically reconnect to this process when re-launched.
Please note that if  multiple ImJoy instances attach to this plugin process, each will call the `setup()` function.
This may cause conflicts, we therefore recommend to (1) keep the interface-related code in the `setup()`, e.g. `api.register()`;
(2) move code that you only want to run once per process into the `__init__` function of the plugin class.


#### icon
Defines the icon used in the plugin menu. You can choose the following formats:
 1. Use material icons, you can find different icons here https://material.io/tools/icons/ and used the specified name;
 2. You can directly copy and paste Emoji, for example from [here](https://getemoji.com/).
 3. Specify an URL to an image in JPEG, PNG or GIF format, recommended size: 64x64.
 4. If you set it as `null` or `""`, it will use `extension` in material icon.

#### inputs
Defines a file/data matching schema which will be used to trigger the plugin. For example, when the user drag and drop a file to the workspace.

You can basically use standard json schema(http://json-schema.org/) to validate the input data object. For example, to define that the plugin uses png files, you can specify `"inputs": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 100}}, "required": ["name"]}`. Under the hood, we use the [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) library to validate the objects. To ease the use of schema, we also extend the standard json schema with the following keywords:

 * `file`: For file objects, use [mime types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) or file name extension. You can use one of the following keywords:
   * `mime`: a common mime type string (or a list). For example `{"file": {"mime": "image/png"}}`. You can also specify a list of mime types: `"mime": ["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/tiff"]`.
   * `ext`: a file extension string (or a list). For example `{"file": {"ext": "png"}}`, Or you can specify a list of extensions: `{"file": {"ext": ["png", "jpg", "jpeg"]}}`. 

 * `ndarray`: For example `{"ndarray": {"shape": [10, 10], "dtype": "uint8"}}`.
   * `shape`: the shape for the array. You need to specify a number for each dimension, or use `null` which means any size for that dimension. For example: `{"type": "ndarray", "shape": [10, 10]}`, or if the first dimension can be any size: `{"type": "ndarray", "shape": [null, 10]}`
   * `dtype`: the data type of the array. For example: `{"ndarray": {"dtype": "uint8"}}` or if we support both `uint8` and `float32`: `{"ndarray": {"dtype": ["uint8", "float32"]}}`. The supported `dtype` are: `["int8", "int16", "int32", "uint8", "uint16", "uint32", "float32", "float64", "array"]`.
   * `ndim`: the number of dimension. For example: ` {"ndarray": {"ndim": 2}}` or if we support both 2D and 3D: ` {"ndarray": {"ndim": [2, 3]}}`

 * For remote url which exposed via http or other protocol, `{"type": "url", "extension": "zarr"}`.



Please also note that if you use a regular expression pattern in the schema to validate an string, you may want to set the `maxLength`, otherwise it will be very slow and can even crash while validating large string. For example, if we want to match an object contains `file_name` which ends with `.tiff`, we can set: `{"properties": {"file_name": {"type": "string","pattern": ".*\\.tiff$", "maxLength": 1024}}}`.


#### outputs
Defines the outputs with json-schema syntax (http://json-schema.org/).
The format is the same as for `inputs`.

#### cmd
(**for python plugins only**) the command used to run the plugin. By default, it will be run with `python`. Depending on the installation it could also be something like `python3` or `python27` etc.

#### env
(**for python plugins only**) the virtual environment or docker image command
used to create an environment to run the plugin.

For more details see the dedicated [section](development?id=virtual-environments)

#### permissions
For `window` plugins, the following permissions can be decleared:
 * camera
 * midi
 * geolocation
 * microphone
 * encrypted-media
 * full-screen
 * payment-request

 For example, if your window plugin requires webcam access, add the following permission:
 ```
 "permissions": ["camera"],
 ```

 **Notice** devices such as camera and microphone can only work when ImJoy is served as `https`, this means your plugin will work if you run it from https://imjoy.io, but it won't run if you are using your own ImJoy server served through `http`. A workaround is to run a tunneling service such as [Telebit](https://telebit.cloud) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to convert your `http` url to `https`. Again, you won't need this if you use https://imjoy.io.


#### requirements
Defines the plugin requirements.

ImJoy provides a large number of options to specify these requirements for public
or private repositories, including `importScripts` for JavaScript, `pip` for Python,
conda environment specified by `environment.yml`, and others.

We refer to the dedicate [section](development?id=specifying-requirements)
for a detailed description.


#### dependencies
Array with names of other ImJoy plugins which the current plugin depends on.

They will be installed automatically during installation. To define a dependency use the following format: 1) for dependencies without tag `REPOSITORY:PLUGIN_NAME` or `PLUGIN_URL`, e.g.: `imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins:Image Window`; 2) or with specified tag: `REPOSITORY:PLUGIN_NAME@TAG` or `PLUGIN_URL@TAG`, e.g.: `imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins:Unet Segmentation@GPU`. In this case, a hash tag `GPU` is used to specify the tag for the plugin named `Unet Segmentation` hosted on GitHub repository `imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins` (https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins). If the plugin is not hosted on GitHub or the GitHub repository is not formatted as a ImJoy plugin repository (meaning there is no `manifest.imjoy.json` file defined in the root of the repository), you can use the url directly, e.g.: `https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-demo-plugins/blob/master/repository/3dDemos.imjoy.html` (tags can be added with `@TAG`).

#### defaults
(**for window plugin only:**) defines an object of default values.

For example, you can specify the default window size by setting `"defaults": {"w": 10, "h": 7}`.

Or, you can make the window in full screen mode by default with `"defaults": {"fullscreen": true}`.

To make the window in standalone mode by default (in full screen and detached from the workspace), you can set `"defaults": {"standalone": true}`.

If you want to show the window as a dialog, then set `"defaults": {"as_dialog": true}`.


#### base_frame
(**for window plugin only:**) defines a custom url to a html page which will be loaded in the window plugin.

While you can use any other website url as the `base_frame`, it needs to fullfil the following criterion before Imjoy core can communicate with your custom `base_frame`:
 1. The site needs allow embedding, and this is not always enabled because they may have strict [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), by a `X-Content-Security-Policy` header, or a `<meta>` element in the page. To solve it, you need to add `*.imjoy.io` to the header if you have control over the site.
 2. Inside the `base_frame`, `imjoy-rpc` protocol need to be enabled. This can be easily done by following the instructions in the [imjoy-core](https://github.com/imjoy-team/ImJoy-core) repo. Please follow the part about "ImJoy RPC library to your website", you basically need to import the `imjoy-loader`, and load the imjoy RPC library, then export your api which you would like to expose to other ImJoy plugins.

Once you have the above fulfilled, you can integrate a third party website as an ImJoy plugin.

#### runnable
Defines whether the plugin can be executed by clicking on the plugin menu (By default, all plugins are `runnable`). For helper plugins which do not run by themselves, (e.g. a `native-python` plugin can be called by a `window` plugin and do not necessarily executed by the user directly), setting `"runnable": false` would move down the plugin to the bottom of the plugin menu and made non-clickable.

### `<docs>` block
Contains the documentation of the plugin and is written in Markdown language.
Please consulte this document for an introduction to [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
Please note that if you provide links that these will be opened in another tab, leaving the ImJoy instance running.

### `<window>` block
Defines the HTML code for the display in the plugin window.

ImJoy uses vue.js to to parse plugin files, which enforces that only
root element exists in the template. This means in the window block you have to use
a division to wrap all nodes:

```html
<window>
  <div>
    <p> line 1</p>
    <p> line 2</p>
  </div>
</window>
```

The following won't work:
```html
<window>
  <p> line 1</p>
  <p> line 2</p>
</window>
```

### `<style>` block
Defines the CSS code for displaying in the plugin window.

### `<script>` block
Contains the actual plugin code.

Plugins can be written in JavaScript or Python, a minimal plugin needs to implement two functions: `setup()` and `run()`. Exceptions are helper plugins (specified with `"runnable": false`), which don't need the `run()` function. Optionally, the function `exit` will be called when the plugin is killed.

  * **`setup()` function**: executed when a plugin is loaded and initialises for the first time.
      it.
  * **`run()` function**: will be called each time a plugin is executed. When executed, an object (for Javascript) or a dictionary (for Python) with context (named `ctx`) will be passed into the function. The returned result will be displayed as a new window or passed to the next `op` in a workflow. More in the section [Plugin during runtime](development?id=plugin-during-runtime) below.
  * optional: **`resume()` function**: only for detachable `native-python` plugins with the `allow-detach` flag, `resume()` will be called (instead of `setup()`) when the ImJoy is reconnected to a running plugin process.  More details about flags can be found [here](development?id=run-time-behaviour-of-native-python-plugins) below.
  * optional: **`update()` function**: will be called when any setting of the op is changed.

The `lang` property of the `<script>` block is used to specify the used programming language:
 * for Javascript, use `<script lang="javascript"> ... </script>`
 * for Python, use `<script lang="python"> ... </script>`

`<script>` also supports `tags`. For more information, see the dedicated section for [`tags`](development?id=tags).

## Specifying requirements

The plugin requirements are specified in the dedicated field
[`requirements`](development?id=requirements)
in its `config` block.

Depending on the plugin type, requirements can be specified differently.

### Web Worker and Window plugins
Requirments are specified as an array of JavaScript urls. These libraries will then be
imported using `importScripts`.

For example, to specify the latest [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) library you can
use
```json
"requirements": ["https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"]
```

For window plugins, you can also specify **CSS urls**, these need to end with `.css`, otherwise, you need to add a prefix `css:` to the url.

For example, to use the [W3.CSS framework](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/), you can specify
```json
"requirements": ["https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css"]
```

If the url does not end with `.css`, you need to add `css:` before it, for example:
```json
"requirements": ["css:https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"]
```

ImJoy hosts **commonly used and tested libraries** in a dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/imjoy-team/static.imjoy.io).
You can refer to all files contained in the `docs` folder with a simple url: `https://static.imjoy.io` + `RelativePathInDocs`.

For example, the file `FileSaver.js` in the folder `static.imjoy.io/docs/js/`
can be referenced as
```json
"requirements": ["https://static.imjoy.io/js/FileSaver.js"]
```

If the url does not end with `.js`, you need to add `js:` before it, for example:
```json
"requirements": ["js:https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.11.2"]
```

For **offline access**, Javascript and CSS files will be automatically cached if added to `requirements`.
You can also add additional resources (e.g. images, font files) to the offline cache by using `cache:` prefix, for example: 
```json
"requirements": ["cache:https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/webfonts/fa-solid-900.woff2"]
```

Notice that the offline caching process won't trace the dependent resources, you will need to add them as requirements manually in order to be cached.

### Web Python
Requirements are specified as a list of strings specifying the required python modules. For instance,

```json
"requirements": ["numpy", "matplotlib"]
```
By default, the packages are loaded from our static hosting on Github (https://github.com/imjoy-team/static.imjoy.io/tree/master/docs/pyodide). Specifically for `scipy`, you need to include an absolute url: `"requirements": ["https://alpha.iodide.app/pyodide-0.10.0/scipy.js"]`.

If you want to import additional js file, you need to use the `js:` prefix before the javascript url.

Please note that `web-python` plugins are based on [pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/)
and only a limited number of python modules is currently supported.


### Native Python plugins

Requirements are defined as a list of strings.
A prefix is used to specify the supported requirement types: `conda:`, `pip:` and `repo:`.

The general syntax is `"requirements": ["prefix:requirementToInstall"]`. The table below
lists all supported requirements, the actual command being executed by ImJoy and
an example.

Prefix  | Command                                                 | Example
--------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
`conda` | `conda install -y`                                      | `"conda:scipy==1.0"`
`pip`   | `pip install`                                           | `"pip:scipy==1.0"`
`repo`  | `git clone` (new repo)  <br> `git pull` (existing repo) | `"repo:https://github.com/userName/myRepo"`
`cmd`   | Any other command                                       | `"cmd:pip install -r myRepo/requirements.txt"`


Some **important considerations**:

*  If **no prefix is used**, requirements will be treated as `pip` libraries.
   ```json
   "requirements": ["numpy", "scipy==1.0"]
   ```

*  If a **virtual environment** is defined by setting `env`, all `pip` and `conda`
   packages will be installed to this environment. For more information see the
   dedicated section on [virtual environments](development?id=virtual-environments).

*  You can list multiple requirements either directly as one string after a prefix:
   ```json
   "requirements": ["conda:numpy scipy==1.0"]
   ```
   or as separate strings in one list:

   ```json
   "requirements": ["conda:numpy", "conda:scipy==1.0"]
   ```
*  Different requirement types can be combined into one list.

   ```json
    "requirements": ["conda:numpy", "pip:scipy==1.0", "repo:https://github.com/userName/myRepo"]
    ```

#### Install Python package from GitHub
If your python module has a working `setup.py` file, you can also use it directly from Github without uploading to Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org)). The way to do it is to provide a URL to your github repo with PyPI format described below. Several excellent resources exist to explain this step,
such as [this one](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

The general syntax is shown below with parameters indicated in `{}`:
 ```json
 "requirements": ["pip:git+https://github.com/{username}/{reponame}@{tagname}#egg={reponame}"]
 ```

 The syntax `"pip:git+https..."` is translated by ImJoy into the command `pip install git+https...`.
 This command allows a [pip install from GIT](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-support).

 The following parameters have to be specified:

 *   `username`: name of the GitHub account.
 *   `reponame`: name of the GitHub repository.
 *   `tagname`:  allows passing of tag. This can be a commit hash tag, a
     [Git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging), or a
     [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), or
     a commit hash tag. This provides precise control
     which version of the repository is installed and used.
 *   `eggname`: this is usually the name of your repository. This is recommended
     for an install of a Git repository, and tells pip what to call the repository for dependency checks.

Please note that once a package is installed, it will not be **upgraded** unless you
specify a new tag.

For a complete description please consult the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#git).

In order to test your module, you can use the `pip` terminal command with the
parameters specified above
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/{username}/{reponame}@{tagname}#egg={reponame}
```

For an example, we refer [here](http://localhost:8000/docs#/development?id=repo-with-setuppy).

### Typical scenarios for plugin requirements
Here we describe typically encountered scenarios to add requirements for public
or your own libraries.

#### pip repositories
Your python module is deployed to as a pip repository (`pip.pypa.io`). You can
then add its pip name to `requirements` including the version number.

For example, to add `scipy` with version 1.0, you can specify

```json
"requirements": ["pip:scipy==1.0"]
```

#### repo with `setup.py`
The `pip` command can install a package and its dependencies from a GitHub repository,
when the `setup.py` is present.

Example: the GitHub repository `myRepo` is hosted on the account `myUserName` and
the latest Git tag is `v0.1.1`. You can then add this repository
```json
"requirements": "pip:git+https://github.com/myUserName/myRepo@v0.1.1#egg=myRepo"
```

We would like to highlight three important aspects:

1.  The syntax `"pip:git+https..."` is translated by ImJoy into the command
    `pip install git+https...` and allows a [pip install from GIT](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-support).

0.  The string `@v0.1.1` is used to specify the [Git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging),
    [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/),
    This provides precise control which version of the repository is installed and used.

For more informations, consult the dedicate section [here](development?id=install-package-from-github).

#### repo with `requirements.txt`
The file `requirements.txt` contains a list of all packages and their version that
are required by the package. For more details see [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files).

Usually, you will add this repository to your workspace. You can then install
the requirements, and also directly import the project directly from a folder.

Example, the GitHub repository `myRepo` is hosted on the account `myUserName`.
To add this repository to the plugin workspace, and install the requirements:
 ```json
 "requirements": ["repo:https://github.com/myUserName/myRepo", "cmd: pip install -r myRepo/requirements.txt"]
 ```

In your Python plugin, you can then add the local copy to the Python system path, and
import libraries from it
```python
sys.path.insert(0, './myRepo')
from  ... import ...
```

#### repo with `environment.yml`
The yaml file `environment.yml` defines a virtual environment with conda and pip
dependencies. A detailed description file format can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually).

Example, the GitHub repository `myRepo` is hosted on the account `myUserName`.
You can add the repo with
```json
"requirements": ["repo:https://github.com/myUserName/myRepo"]
```

and install the environment with
```json
"env": ["conda env create -f myRepo/environment.yml"]
```

#### repo hosted on Dropbox
You could also host your code (and also data) on dropbox and install it from there with
a https request. See our dedicated [demo](demos?id=distribution-of-codedata-stored-on-dropbox)
for more details.


### Virtual environments
By default, Python plugins from ImJoy will be executed in the default conda environment
(e.g. Python 3.6). However, these plugins can have specific virtual conda environments, which provide a way to isolate plugins. You can therefore run them with different versions of Python, or use different conda or pip packages.

We encourage the use of virtual environments per plugin and tag to guarantee stability.  We further recommend specifying the full version numbers (X.X.X) for python, pip and conda packages. By specifying the full version, conda will try to reuse the packages with same version (and python version) across virtual environments, which reduces the required disk space. As an example, the following two environments will reuse the specified scipy package,
but not the numpy package:

```
conda create -n test_env1 python=3.6.8 scipy=1.1.0 numpy=1.16.1
conda create -n test_env2 python=3.6.8 scipy=1.1.0 numpy=1.15.4
```

In order to run a plugin in a different conda environment, you can specify it
by setting the `env` field in the `<config>` section of the plugin.

`env` can be a string or an array. When connecting multiple command in a line please use `&&` or `||` which are supported on different operating systems. If you have several command which are independent from each other, please use an array to store the commands.
For example: `"env": ["export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1", "conda create -n XXXXX python=3.7"]`.

You can also create an environment directly from a `environment.yml` file, e.g.
`"env": "conda env create -f ANNA-PALM/environment.yml"`. This requires
that the repository is defined as a repo in the [plugin requirements](development?id=requirements).
For more information, consult the dedicated [conda help page](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

It is also important to specify the pip packages required by the plugin, this can be done
with the `requirements` field in `<config>`.

Examples:

   * If you want to run your plugin with Python 2.7, you just need to add the following fields to your `<config>`:
  ```json
  <config>
    ...
    "env": "conda create -y -n python2 python=2.7",
    "requirements": ["numpy", "scipy"],
    "cmd": "python",
    ...
  </config>
  ```

   * Similarly, if you want to run your plugin with Python 3.6, you just need to add the following fields to your `<config>`:
  ```json
  <config>
    ...
    "env": "conda create -y -n python3 python=3.6",
    "requirements": ["numpy", "scipy"],
    "cmd": "python",
    ...
  </config>
  ```

  **Note 1**: in `requirements`, you can also specify the version number, for example `numpy==1.15.0`.

  **Note 2**: in the `env` field, you need to use `-n XXXX` to name your environment,
  otherwise, it will use the plugin name to name the environment.

## Plugin programming
Once you configured the plugin, the most important part is to write the actual plugin code in the `<script>` block.

The plugin system of ImJoy is built on remote procedure calls.
An encoding and decoding scheme is used by ImJoy to transfer data and functions
between plugins. We expose a set of API functions (referred to `ImJoy APIs`) for plugins to interact with the main app and also between each other.

Any ImJoy plugin can access `ImJoy APIs` through a predefined object called `api`. They allow interactions with the main ImJoy user interface or between plugins. We refer to the section [ImJoy API functions](/api) for a complete list of the available
ImJoy API functions.

#### Exposing plugin functions
Most importantly, each plugin needs to export an plugin object with a set of functions, which will be registered as plugin API functions (also called `Plugin APIs`). This is done by calling `api.export` at the end of the plugin code. Once exported, these functions can then be registered in ImJoy, and can be invoked by the user from the ImJoy interface or other plugins. Importantly, `setup` and `run` are two mandatory plugin API functions which need to be defined and exported.

When exporting ImJoyPlugin class is exported with the `api.export` as proposed
in the plugin templates, these functions (and all other functions of the ImJoy plugin class)
will be exported. Other plugin functions can be also exported and can then be
called **repeatedly** by other plugins with `api.call` or `api.run`.

#### Callback functions
Plugin functions that were not exported as `Plugin API` functions, can be sent
as an object to another plugin or ImJoy. These function will be will be
treated as a `callback` function and can be only called once.

A typical case example is a notification function that can be used be the called
plugin to inform the calling plugin that a computation is finished. Such a function
has to be called only once.


### Plugin menu
Most plugins can be accessed from the plugin menu, by default `run` function will be called when the user click on the plugin name in the plugin menu. During the execution of the plugin (or `op`, see below), it can access different fields from it first arguments (typically named `ctx`):

 * `ctx.config`
    The config values from the GUI defined with the `ui` string (from the plugin `<config>` block
    or from a separate operation `api.register`, more below). For example, if you defined an ui string (e.g. `"ui": "option {id: 'opt1', type: 'number'}"`) in the plugin `<config>`, you can access it through `ctx.config.opt1`.

 * `ctx.data`
     It stores the data from current active window and state for running the plugin. Notice that, it will be passed to the plugin only if the data matches the `inputs` json schema syntax defined by the plugin or the `op`.

 * `ctx._variables`
     When the plugin is executed in a workflow, variables will be set in the workflow will be passed as `ctx._variables`. It will be set to the actual variable value if the user used ops such as `Set [number]`.

You can directly return your result and they will show as a generic result window.

If you want to define the window type of your result, you can return an object with at least two fields `type` and `data`.
ImJoy will use `type` to find the window for rendering the result stored in `data`.

In the example below, the image from an url will be displayed in a image window or passed to the next op in a workflow.

```javascript
   return { "type": "imjoy/image", "data": {"src": "https://imjoy.io/static/img/imjoy-icon.png"} }
```

ImJoy uses postMessage to exchange data between plugins. This means that for JavaScript
plugins, objects are cloned during the transfer. If large objects are exchanged,
if the created objects are not directly transferred. To enable that, you can
add `_transfer=true` to your object when you return it. In the above
example, you can set `ctx._transfer = true` when you return `ctx`. However, it will
only speed up the transferring of `ArrayBuffers` or `ArrayBufferViews` (and also
ndarrays produced by Python), and after transferring, you won't be able to access it.

(**Note**: in Python, the data type of `ctx` is a dictionary, ImJoy added the interface for allowing dot notation, just like in JavaScript. If you prefer, you can also use `[]` in both languages to access dictionary or object.)

<!-- ## Advanced options -->

### Plugin operators (ops)
You can define for a plugin independent operators (or **ops**) with the Plugin
API (see **api.register** for details). Each of these **ops** is defined in a similar fashion as
the `<config>` block: you can define an interface to set parameters, and it can have a dedicated run function.
The different ops are displayed when you press on the arrow down button in the plugin list.


### Data exchange

#### Loading/saving files

Files stored on the file system can be accessed in different ways in ImJoy.

For accessing local files without the plugin engine, the user will need to open or drag
files into ImJoy, and the result files can only be saved by triggering downloads.

On the other hand, the **Plugin Engine** has full access to the local file system,
native python plugins can read and write directly from the local file system.

![imjoy-data-accessibility](assets/imjoy-data-accessibility.png ':size=800')

Therefore, we provide several different ways to handle loading/saving files for plugins
with or without the plugin engine.

 *  If the **Plugin Engine** is running, there are three api functions for **all** types of
    plugins to access the local file system: `api.showFileDialog`, `api.getFileUrl`, `api.requestUploadUrl`.
    Specifically for **Python plugins** running on the plugin engine, files can be directly
    loaded and written to the file system with standard python file operations.

 *   If the **Plugin Engine** is not running, the only way for **JavaScript** or **Web Python plugins** to access
     files is ask the user to drag a file or a folder directly into the ImJoy workspace. This will render a window
     with content of the file or folder. These data can then be accessed by the plugins and be processed.
     For exporting result as files, the `api.exportFile` function can be used to trigger a download.


Comparing to plugins running through the plugin engine, web plugin running
in browser cannot directly access your local file system, thus they provide much higher security than `native-python` plugins.

#### Exchanging data through function calls
For small amount of data (e.g.: array, object etc.) generated during runtime, you can send them to another plugin by passing the data object as arguments during a API function call, or by returning the data object from the api function.

For example, you can directly send data (<10MB) containing small numpy arrays, strings, bytes from a `native-python` plugin running in a remote plugin engine to a `window` plugin running in the browser.

For quick display of an small image, you can save it as png format and encode it as base64 strings which can then be directly displayed with a standard HTML `<img>` tag.

```python
with open("output.png", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()
    result = base64.b64encode(data).decode('ascii')
    imgurl = 'data:image/png;base64,' + result
    api.createWindow(name='unet prediction', type='imjoy/image', w=7, h=7, data= {"src": imgurl})
```

#### Pass data through windows
Window displayed in ImJoy can contain data, e.g. an image, so you can use it as a way to pass data from one plugin to another.

When selecting such a window and executing a plugin (by clicking the plugin menu), the contained data will be transferred to the Python plugin.
Importantly, if the data object contained in the window is acceptable to the plugin by matching the json schema defined by `inputs` in its `<config>`, ImJoy will pass the data contained in the window to the plugin function. The plugin can then process the data (typically within the `run` function), by accessing `ctx.data`.

Natively, ImJoy supports the conversion and transmission of Numpy arrays and
Tensorflow tensors. Plugin developers could just use those data types and exchange
them between plugins, no matter if they are in Python or JavaScript.

#### Handling large data volumes
Potentially, you can send large files in smaller chunks but this is not optimal and
may block normal communication between the engine and the ImJoy app. We recommend to store the data on the disk (in the workspace directory for example), then use `api.getFileUrl` to generate an url to access the file. The generated url can then be send to the web App and accessed with a download link or using JavaScript libraries such as `axios`. Many libraries such as Three.js, Vega etc. can load files through url directly.


### Workflow management
We provide additional fields in `ctx` that allow to track, maintain and reconstruct an entire analysis workflow.

* `ctx._op`
    Give the name of the op which is being executing. When a plugin registered for multiple ops and no callback function was specified for the op, the `run` function will be called, and you can use `ctx._op` to determine which op is being executing.
* `ctx._source_op`
    Give the name of the op which initiated current execution.
* `ctx._workflow_id`
    When the plugin is executed in a workflow, its id will be passed here. When the plugin is executed from the plugin menu, ImJoy will try to reuse the workflow id in the current active window, if no window is active, a new workflow id will be assigned. All the data window with the same `_workflow_id` is virtually connected in a pipeline or computational graph. By combining `_workflow_id` with `_op` and `_source_op`,

 Importantly, `_workflow_id`, `_variables`, `_op` and `_source_op` can be used to implement interactivity between plugins, meaning if the user changed a state in one of the result window, the downstream workflow will be updated automatically.

### Execution flags of native Python plugins
You can control the execution of a Python plugin process with the `flags` field in the `<config>` block. Next we provide next nomenclature and additional explanations to explain the different options you have to control how the Python processes running on the plugin engine interact with the ImJoy interface.

![imjoy-python-process](assets/imjoy-python-process.png ':size=800')

* **Interface**: web interface of ImJoy. You can have ImJoy running on multiple browser windows, i.e. multiple interfaces.
* **Plugin Engine**: running in the background to execute Python code from different Python plugins.
* **Python plugin**: plugin containing Python code. Some plugins might have **`tags`** to further specify details of how they are executed.
* **Python process**: specific Python plugin running on the Plugin engine. Processes can be seen on the Task Manager.
* **Workspace**: collection of installed ImJoy plugins. For plugins with `tags`, the user choses the appropriate tag. Each Python plugin within a workspace has its own process. Each workspace has a unique name.
* **ImJoy instance** is a workspace running in one ImJoy interface.

Below we describe the three execution flags for controlling the execution of python plugins:
* By **default** (none of the flags is set), each ImJoy instance has its own process on the plugin engine. If you close the interface, you will kill the process.
* The **`single-instance`** flag will allow only one process to run for the entire plugin engine. For plugins with the same name and tag, then the `single-instance` means that they access the same process.

* The **`allow-detach`** flag means that the process is not killed when its ImJoy instance is closed. For instance, this allows to perform long computational tasks in the background which don't require additional user feedback and which terminate autonomously. Can also be used to protect a long computational tasks against browser instabilities. If you want to be able to attach to a detached process, you can reconnect from the same browser and workspace, or have the `single-instance` flag which works despite connecting from different browser and workspace.

When ImJoy is trying to reconnect a previously detached plugin process, `resume()` will be called if it was defined in the plugin class, otherwise call `setup()` as usual. Notice that when `resume` is present, `setup` won't be called during the reattachment.

This is how the `flags` option looks like in the `<config>` block:
```json
<config lang="json">

  ...
  "flags": ["single-instance", "allow-detach"],
  ...

</config>
```
Optionally, the `flags` can be made configurable with `tags`, for example:
```json
<config lang="json">

  ...
  "tags": ["Single", "Multi"],
  "flags": {"Single": ["single-instance", "allow-detach"], "Multi": []},
  ...

</config>
```
The above `<config>` block will create a plugin with two tags(`Single` and `Multi`). During installation, the user which run-time behavior he would like to use (either a single instance of the plugin process (`Single`), or multiple plugin processes if multiple ImJoy interface with the same workspace are opened (`Multi`)).



## Building user interface
An important part of ImJoy is to provide a flexible way to interact with the user, to either specify input information or generate output in a rich and interactive manner.

ImJoy comes with a set of basic elements such as forms and progress bars which provide a way to interact with user.
More advanced and powerful user interfaces can be also built with customized windows where developers can utilize web based UI library for generating controls, interactive charts or render 3D views.

### **Basic user input and output**

The easiest way to acquire user input is using a form generated by ImJoy.
You can define a `gui` string in the [`<config>` block](development?id=ltconfiggt-block), which will be rendered as a form under the plugin menu. If multiple [**plugin operations**](api?id=apiregister) are used for the plugin, you can also provide `gui` strings for each plugin op.

When the user run the plugin or the op through the plugin menu, all the values for fields defined in the `gui` string will be wrapped as a `config` object and passed into the `run` function. You can then access them through `ctx.config.FIELD_ID`.

For other types of inputs, other ImJoy API can be used, for example popup a [file dialog](api?id=apishowfiledialog).

To show results or provide feedback to the user, ImJoy provides several API functions to show results, e.g. show message with [`api.alert()`](api?id=apialert) or [`api.showMessage()`](api?id=apishowmessage), log message or error with [`api.log()`](api?id=apilog) or [`api.error()`](api?id=apierror), indicate [progress](api?id=apishowprogress), update the [ImJoy status](api?id=apishowstatus).


### **User input and output with custom windows**

For more flexible user interfaces, developers can make a dedicated window plugin. Since it is based on `iframe`, most of the frontend(HTML/CSS/JS) frameworks can be used in the window plugin. Further, such an interface can communicate with another plugin, e.g. a Python plugin that performs the actual analysis.

Such a plugin can be easily created by using the `Window` plugin template. In addition to a other plugins, a window plugin has two extra code blocks: `<window>` and `<style>`. User can add frontend code to the corresponding code blocks. Once created, the provided window plugin will be used as a template to create new window instances.

ImJoy provides two API functions to either [create a window](api?id=apicreatewindow) or [show a dialog](api?id=apishowdialog) from a window plugin.

Besides that, for commonly used window types, ImJoy support a set of internal window types([more details](api?id=apicreatewindow)).

For more details, have a look at the dedicated demo below.

## Hosting and deploying plugins
Here, we provide detailed information for how to host or deploy ImJoy plugins.

Hosting and deployment options range from storing single file to setting up
your own ImJoy plugin repository. The plugins can then be distributed directly as files or
with a dedicated url syntax, which allows an automatic installation.

The **default and recommended** way for ImJoy plugin is to deploy on GitHub (either
as an individual file or in a plugin repository) and then distribute with a plugin url.
We recommend GitHub since it provides stability and version control, which guarantees
reproducibility and traceability.

### Hosting individual plugin files
This is the typical case during development.

The plugin code can be hosted on the web, e.g. GitHub, Gist, or Dropbox.

### Own ImJoy plugin repository
You can easily create a ImJoy plugin repository for an existing GitHub project.

A template project can be found [here](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-project-template).
For this, you save your ImJoy plugins in a dedicated folder, and add a
manifest json file `manifest.imjoy.json` to the GitHub root folder.

This manifest specifies which plugins are in your repository,
and where they can be found. A skeleton of this file is shown below,
and a full template can be found [here](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-project-template/blob/master/manifest.imjoy.json).
```json
{
 "name": "NAME OF THE REPOSITORY",
 "description": "DESCRIBE THE REPOSITORY",
 "version": "0.1.0",
 "uri_root": "",
 "plugins": [
   //copy and paste the <config> block of your plugin here
 ]
}
```

You can then update this manifest either **automatically** or **manually**:

1.  For an **automatic update**, we provide a [node script](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-project-template/blob/master/update_manifest.js).
    This script requires node.js to be executed. Then run it  with the command `node update_manifest.js` in the root folder
    containing `manifest.imjoy.json`. It will then automatically search for ImJoy plugins and
    generate the manifest.

    Please note that when you use this node script for the first time, you have to manually change
    the name of the plugin repository `name`. For subsequent updates, the name will remain.

2.  For a **manual update**, follow these steps:
    1. Place all plugin files in a folder in your GitHub repository.
       For example, a folder called [imjoy-plugins](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-project-template/tree/master/imjoy-plugins).
    1. Modify the `manifest.imjoy.json`. For each plugin
        1. Copy & paste the content of the `<config>` block from the plugin code
           to the `plugins` block in `manifest.imjoy.json`.
        1. Add a field called `"uri"`, and set the value to the actual file name
           of your plugin file, including the relative path within the GitHub repository.
           For example for a plugin file is named `untitledPlugin.imjoy.html` you have
           to specify `"uri": "imjoy-plugins/untitledPlugin.imjoy.html"`
           if your . You can skip this step if you name your plugin file exactly as the file name of the plugin.

In ImJoy, you can then **render a list of all plugins** in the repository with a
simple url with the form `http://imjoy.io/#/app?repo=GITHUB_USER_NAME/REPO_NAME`,
where `GITHUB_USER_NAME` is the user name, and `REPO_NAME` the name of the GitHub
repository containing the ImJoy plugin repository. The user can then install the
plugins from this list. For more details on how to generate this url and see how
specific plugins can be installed see the dedicated section below.


### Official ImJoy plugin repository
The ImJoy plugin repository shown on `ImJoy.io` is served through
[GitHub](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins).

In order to deploy your plugin to the [plugin repository](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins),
you can fork the repository, add your plugin and send a pull request.
Once the pull request is accepted, the user will be able to install your plugin from the plugin repository.


## Distributing plugins
To distribute your plugins, two main options exist.

1. You can create a **complete url**. When clicked, ImJoy will automatically open
and install the plugin. This link that can be shared directly through email or
social networks. We detail below how this link can be created and which options are supported.

1. You can **directly send** the plugin file (extension `*.imjoy.html`). This file can then
be dragged into the ImJoy workspace, where it will be automatically recognised as a plugin.

In the last section, we describe how plugins **depending on custom libraries** can be
distributed.

<!-- THIS MIGHT BE CONFUSING.
In last option, which we typically don't recommend, you can send an url pointing
to the plugin file. This url can then be used to install the plugin in ImJoy:
press the `+ Plugins` button and add the url in the field `Install plugin from url`.
However, this option provides less control about how the plugin should be installed.
-->
### Distribute plugins with custom libraries
If your plugin depends on non-standard libraries and modules, you have to provide
them with your plugin. You can upload those libraries and modules to a GitHub repository,
GitHub Gist, or other data-sharing platforms such as Dropbox and link them in the plugin code.

 *  For **JavaScript** plugins, you need to create a Gist or GitHub.
    Upload the plugin (ending with `.imjoy.html`) file together with the other JavaScript files.

    In the plugin file, you can then add the url to the plugin `requirements`.
    However, due to GitHub restrictions, you can't use the GitHub url directly,
    but you have to convert it with [combinatronics.com](https://combinatronics.com/).

 *  For **Python** plugins, we recommend to package your library as a pip module
    on GitHub. For more information, consult the dedicated section [here](development?id=install-package-from-github).


### Distribution of code/data stored on Dropbox
This example describes how you can deploy and distribute a Python plugin stored on Dropbox.
This allows to share projects that are private.

1. The **code** or **data** is stored as a zip file on Dropbox. This allows to change
the code/data by replacing the zip file (see Notes below).
2. The ImJoy plugin file (`.imjoy.html`) is hosted with a secret or public **gist**.

Let's assume the python code is in a Zip archive `testcode.zip` stored on Dropbox and
available with the link `DROPBOXLINK/testcode.zip`. You can then place the following code-fragment in the `setup()` function of your plugin to make it available. This fragment performs the following steps

1. Performs an [http request](http://docs.python-requests.org). Please note the **dl=1** option in this request. By default this value is set to 0.
2. Uses the returned request object to generate the zip file locally, unpacks it, and finally deletes it.
3. Add the local path to the system path.

```python
import sys
import os
import requests
import zipfile

url = 'https://DROPBOXLINK/testcode.zip?dl=1'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)

# download the zip file
name_zip = os.path.join('.','testcode.zip')
open(name_zip, 'wb').write(r.content)

# extract to the current folder (i.e. workspace)
with zipfile.ZipFile(name_zip, 'r') as f:
    f.extractall('./')
os.remove(name_zip)

# If you want to import your python modules, append the folder to sys.path
sys.path.append(os.path.join('.','testcode'))
```

**Notes**
1. Code is locally stored in `USER_HOME/ImJoyWorkspace/WORKSPACENAME/testcode`, where WORKSPACENAME is the name of the current ImJoy workspace. You can set the workspace automatically in the URL your provide to distribute your plugin (next section).
2. When updating the zip archive, don't delete the old one REPLACE it with the new version. This guarantees that the same link is valid.
3. This code will install each time the plugin is called the current version the zip archive.

### Generating a plugin url for sharing
The easiest way to distribute plugins is by creating a url, which can be shared through email or social networks.

The basic format is `http://imjoy.io/#/app?plugin=PLUGIN_URI`. You will need to
replace `PLUGIN_URI` with your actual **plugin URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier).
For example: [https://imjoy.io/#/app?plugin=https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins/blob/master/repository/imageWindow.imjoy.html](https://imjoy.io/#/app?plugin=https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins/blob/master/repository/imageWindow.imjoy.html). When the user click this link,
a plugin installation dialog will be shown which proposes to install the specified plugin.
The user has to simply confirm by clicking `Install`.

This url supports additional parameters controlling how the plugin is loaded.
These parameters are described in a dedicated section below.

There are **two types of URI**, depending on how your plugin is deployed:

1.  If your plugins are deployed in a **`ImJoy Plugin Repository`** (as described above),
    you can then use a short plugin URI formatted as `GITHUB_USER_NAME/REPO_NAME:PLUGIN_NAME`.

    For example, you can use `imjoy-team/imjoy-project-template:Untitled Plugin` to represent
    a plugin hosted on https://github.com/oeway/DRFNS-Lite.

    You can also specify the **plugin tag** by adding `@TAG` after the `PLUGIN_NAME`.
    For example: `oeway/DRFNS-Lite:DRFNS-Lite@GPU`.

    In case you want to specify a **git commit hashtag** to freeze the plugin at a
    certain commit, you can add `@COMMIT_HASHTAG` after the `REPO_NAME`.
    For example: `oeway/DRFNS-Lite@4063b24:DRFNS-Lite` where `4063b24` is the short
    form of the commit of [4063b24f01eab459718ba87678dd5c5db1e1eda1](https://github.com/oeway/DRFNS-Lite/tree/4063b24f01eab459718ba87678dd5c5db1e1eda1).

2.  Alternatively, you can use an **url pointing to the plugin** hosted on any
    websites including your own project site, blog, GitHub, Gist or Dropbox.
    Notice that, the plugin file needs to end with `.imjoy.html`. Below we describe
    how to obtain this url for different hosting platforms:

    1. For files on **GitHub**, you just need to copy the link to the file.
       For example: `https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins/blob/master/repository/imageRecognition.imjoy.html`.

    0.  For **Gist** or other Git providers such as (GitLab), if there is only one file in the Gist, you can use the direct Gist link (copied from your browser address bar) or obtain the `raw`
        link of the plugin file. For a Gist with multiple file, you need to specify the `raw` link for the plugin file you would like to use. 
        
        To create a Gist `raw` link:

        1. Go to Gist on your GitHub account [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/)
        0. Create new Gist, specify the plugin name followed by `.imjoy.html`, and copy & paste the code of your plugin.
        0. Create either a public or secret Gist.
        0. Link to Gist can be obtained from the `Raw` button (this links to the unprocessed versions of the file).
           The link will looks like this: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/oeway/aad257cd9aaab448766c6dc287cb8614/raw/909d0a86e45a9640c0e108adea5ecd7e78b81301/chartJSDemo.imjoy.html`
        0. Please note that this url will change when you update your file.

    0. For **Dropbox** you need to modify the sharable url as follows:
         1. Replace `dl=0` to `dl=1`;
         2. Replace `https://www.dropbox.com/` to `https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/`.

    To specify the plugin tag, you can just append `@TAG` right after `.imjoy.html`. For example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oeway/DRFNS-Lite/master/DRFNS-Lite.imjoy.html@GPU`.

You can test in ImJoy if your plugin url works: paste it in the `+ PLUGINS` dialog
(`Install from URL`) and press `Enter`. If everything works, you should be able
to see a card rendered with your plugins which you can click `INSTALL`.

### Supported url parameters
You can construct the ImJoy url with customised functionality for facilitated installation.
These url parameters can be used after `https://imjoy.io/#/app?`, using a `PARAM=VALUE` syntax.

These parameters are independent from each other and multiple parameters
can be concatenate with `&`. For example we want to specify `par1=99` and `par2=hello`,
the corresponding url would be `https://imjoy.io/#/app?par1=99&par2=hello`.

The following url parameters are currently supported:

 *  `plugin` or `p`: show the specified plugin in the plugin management dialog as
     detailed in the section above. If the plugin with the same name and version exists, the dialog will not shown.
     If needed, add `upgrade=1` to force show the plugin dialog. For example: `https://imjoy.io/#/app?p=imjoy-team/imjoy-demo-plugins:alert&upgrade=1`.
 *   `workspace` or `w`: name of workspace. ImJoy will switch to the specified
     workspace if it exist, or create a new one. For example, `https://imjoy.io/#/app?workspace=test`
 *   `engine` or `e`: define the url of the plugin engine. For example: `http://imjoy.io/#/app?engine=http://127.0.0.1:9527`.
     Note that if you want to connect to a remote machine through a http (not https) connection,
     you can only do it by using `http://imjoy.io` and not `https://imjoy.io`.

     This restriction also exist if you use localhost with some browsers (e.g. Firefox).
     To avoid it, you need to use `http://127.0.0.1:9527` rather than `http://localhost:9527`,
     because most browser will consider `127.0.0.1` is a secured connection, but not `localhost`.
     However, there is an exception, on Safari, using `127.0.0.1` does not work due to
     [this restriction](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934),  please use
     Firefox or Chrome instead.

 *   `token` or `t`: define the connection token. For example: `http://imjoy.io/#/app?token=2760239c-c0a7-4a53-a01e-d6da48b949bc`
 *   `repo` or `r`: specify a ImJoy manifest file pointing to a ImJoy plugin repository (see above).
      This can be a full repo link such as `repo=https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins`
      or a simplified GitHub link `repo=imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins`.

      If you are hosting your repo from a non-GitHub website (e.g. GitLab), please
      use the `raw` link to the `manifest.imjoy.json` file.

 *   `start` or `s`: define a startup plugin name which will be started automatically after ImJoy web app loaded.
      All the url parameters will be passed to the plugin as `ctx.config` to the `run(ctx)` function. This allows you to add customized arguments and use them in `run(ctx)`. For example, a plugin can load an image automatically with `load=URL` and set the width and height of the image with, for example, `width=1024&height=2048`. For example, pass `123` to the `run` function of the plugin as `ctx.data.x`: `https://imjoy.io/#/app?x=123&start=AwesomePlugin`.

      If you are starting a window plugin, you can also set `standalone` or `fullscreen` to `1` to make the window detached from the workspace or in full screen mode. For example: `https://imjoy.io/#/app?x=123&start=AwesomeWindowPlugin&fullscreen=1`.

 *   `load` or `l`: define an URL for making a http GET request, this parameter should only used when you defined a startup plugin with `start` or `s`. The data fetched from the URL will be passed to the startup plugin `run(ctx)` function as `ctx.data.loaded`.


## Access Plugin Engine from command line
The installation of the Plugin Engine will setup an **Miniconda environment**
located in `~/ImJoyApp`. You can access this Miniconda environment from the
command line interface.

For **Linux or MacOS**, you need to add `~/ImJoyApp/bin` to your `$PATH`:
```bash
export PATH=~/ImJoyApp/bin:$PATH

# now you can use `conda`, `pip`, `python` provided from ~/ImJoyApp
which conda

# start the plugin engine
python -m imjoy

```

For **Windows**, you can use a powershell and add the ImJoyApp to `$env.Path`:
```bash
$env:Path = '%systemdrive%%homepath%\ImJoyApp;%systemdrive%%homepath%\ImJoyApp\Scripts;' + $env:Path;

# now you can use `conda`, `pip`, `python` provided from ~/ImJoyApp
(Get-Command conda.exe).Path

# start the plugin engine
python -m imjoy
```

## Setup your own server for ImJoy App and the Plugin Engine

While you can run the plugin engine to run computation tasks, you can also use it to serve a mirrored version of ImJoy app (with the `--serve` option).
Follow these steps, and you will be able to run ImJoy server and the plugin engine yourself:

1. Install Python plugin engine on the remote computer. If this remote machine is
  running under Linux, you can connect with SSH, and run a provided installation
  script: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-engine/master/utils/Linux_Install.sh  -O - | bash`.
  Otherwise, download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-app/releases).

0. Update the `$PATH` settings as explained [above](#access-the-plugin-engine-from-a-command-line-interface).
  For Linux or Mac, use `export PATH=~/ImJoyApp/bin:$PATH`

0. Launch Python plugin engine on remote computer and allow access. We recommend
  to login the remote server with SSH, start the plugin engine with `python -m imjoy --serve --host=0.0.0.0`.
  By default, the host is to `127.0.0.1`, which allows only local connections. For remote access, the host is set to `0.0.0.0`.
  The plugin engine will be launched and serve a copy of the ImJoy app through `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:9527`.
  At the end of the initialisation process, it will display the **connection token**.
  Copy it from the terminal, since you will need it in the next step. **KEEP THIS TOKEN PRIVATE!!!!**

0. If you have a domain name or host name configured to your host, you can specify it by using `--base_url=YOUR_REMOTE_HOST`. For example:  `python -m imjoy --serve --host=0.0.0.0 --base_url=https://hello-imjoy.com`. With this approach, you can also configure a `https` proxy with [nginx for example](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/securing-http-traffic-upstream/), and then your will be able to use your server with `https://imjoy.io`.

0. On your local machine, use your web browser to access the ImJoy app on the remote machine
  with `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:9527` (instead of `https://imjoy.io` ). Then connect
  to the plugin engine by using `http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP:9527` as host and
  the **connection token** you get when you start the engine. If you have `base_url` configured, please replace `YOUR_REMOTE_IP` to your actual domain name or host name.

0. Importantly, the ImJoy app served from https://imjoy.io won't be able to connect a remote plugin engine served with http. You will need to setup your own https proxy, or use an existing one such as [Telebit](https://telebit.cloud/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).


## Change log

### API changes
#### api_version: 0.1.8
 * `api.showFileDialog`:
   - if the file manager provide `showFileDialog` function, then ImJoy will use it.
   - remove the key `uri_type` from input arguments, remove `engine` from its result.
   - it will always return an array of items.
 * support `base_frame` (in `<config>` block) option for `window` plugins to load from a custom html url.
 * support creating window or dialog from an external web page, for example:  `api.createWindow({type: "external", src: "https://kitware.github.io/itk-vtk-viewer/app", passive: true})`.
 * fix `api.alert` display when passing an object
 
#### api_version: 0.1.7
 * `api.fs` has been deprecated, the browser file system is moved to a separate plugin `BrowserFS`, to use the file system, you can do `const bfs_plugin = await api.getPlugin('BrowserFS'); const bfs = bfs_plugin.fs;`, now `fs` will be equivalent to `api.fs`. Notice: the data saved with `api.fs` will not be accessible with the new API, to get access the old data, please change `api_version` in the plugin config to `0.1.6`.
 * added `_rpcEncode` and `_rpcDecode` to support custom encoding and decoding
 * remove `api.utils.assert` because the async version is misleading
 
#### api_version: 0.1.6
 * added new api functions `api.getPlugins`,  `api.getFileManager`, `api.getEngine`, `api.getEngineFactory`
 * `api.getFileUrl` is deprecated, call `file_manager = await api.getFilemanager('http://...');` and then access them with `file_manager.getFileUrl`.
 * `api.requestUploadUrl` is deprecated, call `file_manager = await api.getFilemanager('http://...');` and then access them with `file_manager.requestUploadUrl`.
 * since `api_version > 0.1.6` you must specify the `lang` field for the `<config>` block, e.g.: `<config lang="json">`.
