# Contributing to ImJoy

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to ImJoy.

If you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [https://imjoy.io/docs/](https://imjoy.io/docs/)?
At the top of each page there's an `Edit on github` link that will allow you to suggest changes to the documentation via GitHub.

If you want to contribute to the source code of ImJoy follow these steps.

1. Please keep the change as small as possible. A small PR will be easier to review and get merged faster. Two small PRs are always merged faster than one bigger PR.
2. Fork the ImJoy git repository.
3. Write the code for your change.
4. Ensure tests work.
5. Create a Pull Request against the master branch of ImJoy.

Please have a look at the [developer documentation](https://imjoy.io/docs/#/development) to get more details.
