# Getting Started

Here we describe briefly the main concepts of ImJoy and get you started with a
simple plugin to do some image processing.

For more detailed description of use ImJoy, we refer to the section **User Manual**
For developers, we provide more information about how to develop plugins in
the section **Development**, and we provide a detailed description of the entire **ImJoy API**.


## Launching ImJoy and its interface
ImJoy can be used directly in your browser. When you launch ImJoy (https://imjoy.io),
you will see a welcome screen where you can start the actual ImJoy app with the
button `Start ImJoy`. This will open the app and you will see an interface with
all the functionality needed to process data.

## Plugins
The entire functionality of ImJoy is provided by plugins. To install new plugins
from the [Plugin Repository](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Plugins), click **+ PLUGINS**.
This will show a window with all available plugins with a short description.
A longer description can be obtained by pressing on the **...** and **Docs**.
To install a plugin, press on the cloud button, no further confirmation is required.

Once a plugin is installed, you can open a **plugin specific menu**, by
pressing on the down arrow right to plugin name. This will shows (if applicable)
a list of parameters which determine the plugin behavior. You can **execute**
the plugin by pressing on its title.

To obain more information about an installed plugin, press on the icon left of they
plugin name and select **Docs**. This will show a new window with a detailed
description of how the plugin works. Other options to remove, terminate, or share
the plugin with and url are provided as well.

Plugins have the ðŸš€ symbol next to their title are written in native Python, and
usually developed for advanced image processing. To execute them,
[**Python Plugin Engine**](user_manual?id=imjoy-app-and-plugin-engine) needs
to be installed.

## Example - image recognition
Here, we describe how to install a ImJoy plugin to perform image recognition.

This plugin can be obtained by installing the plugin `Image Recognition` from
the ImJoy plugin repository. Alternatively, you can also use this
<a href="https://imjoy.io/#/app?plugin=oeway/ImJoy-Plugins:Image Recognition&w=getting-started" target="_blank">**link**</a>,
which will open ImJoy and provide a dialog where you can confirm the installation.

This plugin provides an image recognition based on a pre-trained neural network.
You can start the plugin by pressing on its name. This will open a window
and the trained network is loaded. Then you can perform image recognition by
pressing on the `predict` button. You can either predict the already displayed image
of a cat, or upload your own file. The prediction is displayed as an ImJoy message and also in
the window itself.

You can run this plugin even on your **mobile phone**. Here, rather than uploading
and image, you will be able to snap an image and perform a prediction.
