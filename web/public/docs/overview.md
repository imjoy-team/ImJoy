# ImJoy

ImJoy is a flexible image processing framework for the deployment of complex
computational tasks in a robust, secure and easy-to-use environment. The entire functionality is provided by **plugins**. These plugins can be assembled into **workflows** in a modern graphical user-interface. Plugins can be grouped and installed into isolated workspaces avoiding overcrowded plugin menus. This design makes ImJoy intuitive to work with for end users.

Imjoy consists of **two parts**:
1. the **user interface**
2. the **computational backend**

While the ImJoy web app alone can perform computational tasks with the powerful Javascript engine and WebGL providing GPU access, adding an additional computational backend allows ImJoy to access the entire Python ecosystem. The plugin engine can be launched either on the local machine, or remotely to perform compuationally intensive tasks on dedicated workstations, e.g. with state-of-the-art GPUs.

By design, ImJoy itself provides very minimal task specific functionality, it provides a flexible plugin interface to support plugins to extend the user interface and perform compuational tasks. Plugins can be designed to perform  simple tasks such as reading tif file, or more complex tasks such as training a deep learning model for image segmentation.

## Acknowledgements

This is a non-exhaustive list of the open-source tools and libraries we used in ImJoy:
 * [Joy.js](https://github.com/ncase/joy) (This is where the name `ImJoy` comes from!)
 * [Jailed](https://github.com/asvd/jailed) (This helps ImJoy to isolate plugins)
 * [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (The main ImJoy App is written in Vue.js)
 * [vue-grid-layout](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout) (For window management)
 * [python-socketio](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio) (This how the plugin engine talk with the ImJoy app)
 * [pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) (Enables web python mode with WebAssembly)
 * [conda](https://conda.io/) (The plugin engine uses Conda for managing virtual env. and pacakges)

We thank all the authors for offering these excellent work to the open-source community.
