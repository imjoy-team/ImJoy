## ImJoy - Deep Learning Made Easy!

---

**New**: The ImJoy paper is out [on Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0627-0), check it out via the [free link](https://rdcu.be/bYbGO).

**New**: We are working actively on supporting Jupyter notebook based engines, ImJoy now comes with a `Jupyter Engine Manager`, which enables running Python plugins via [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org) or your own Jupyter notebook server. With the preview version, you will be able to try and test ImJoy Python plugins without additional setup. Stay tuned, more enhanced features will come soon.

---

ImJoy is a plugin powered hybrid computing platform for deploying deep learning applications such as advanced image analysis tools.

ImJoy runs on mobile and desktop environment cross different operating systems, plugins can run in the browser, localhost, remote and cloud servers.

With ImJoy, delivering Deep Learning tools to the end users is simple and easy thanks to
its flexible plugin system and sharable plugin URL. Developer can easily add rich and interactive web interfaces to existing Python code.

 * Easy-to-use workflow composition
 * Isolated workspaces for grouping plugins
 * Self-contained plugin prototyping and development
   - Built-in code editor, no extra IDE is needed for development
 * Powerful and extendable computational backends for browser, local and cloud computing
   - Support Javascript, native Python and web Python
   - Concurrent plugin execution through asynchronous programming
   - Run Python plugins in the browser with Webassembly
   - Browser plugins are isolated with secured sandboxes
   - Support `async/await` syntax for Python3 and Javascript
   - Support Conda virtual environments and pip packages for Python
   - Support libraries hosted on Github or CDNs for javascript
   - Easy plugin deployment and sharing through GitHub or Gist

## Quick Start

The easiest way to try ImJoy is to start with a plugin running directly in the browser.

For example, you can install our `Image Recognition` plugin with [this link](https://imjoy.io/#/app?plugin=imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins:Image%20Recognition&workspace=getting-started).
Clicking the link will open the ImJoy Web App and show a dialog to confirm the
installation of the plugin. Once installed, you can launch the plugin by clicking
the button `Image Recognition` in the plugin menu on the left. The demo plugin
will run a trained deep neural network model (MobileNet) to perform image
classification (e.g. identifying an elephant in an image).

This plugin uses your browser as its computational backend, so all
computation is done locally, no data will be sent to a remote server.

Besides running plugins in the browser, ImJoy provides the flexibility to keep
the GUI locally in your browser, and perform computational tasks with Python.
These computations can be performed on your computer utilising the full power
of the local GPU/CPU. The computational backend can also be launched on remote servers
including cloud servers on Amazon, Google Compute, or an institutional computing cluster.

Previously, running Python plugins would require installation of the Plugin Engine. However, now we have added experimental support for running Python plugins via the servers provided by MyBinder.org.
You can try for example the [DeepBindScan](https://imjoy.io/#/app?plugin=imjoy-team/imjoy-plugins:DeepBindScan) plugin without any installation.
