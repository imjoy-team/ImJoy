## ImJoy - Deploying Deep Learning Made Easy!

ImJoy is a plugin powered hybrid computing platform for deploying deep learning applications such as advanced image analysis tools.

ImJoy runs on mobile and desktop environment cross different operating systems, plugins can run in the browser, localhost, remote and cloud servers.

With ImJoy, delivering Deep Learning tools to the end users is simple and easy thanks to
its flexible plugin system and sharable plugin URL. Developer can easily add rich and interactive web interfaces to existing Python code.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to try ImJoy is to start with a plugin running directly in the browser.

For example, you can install our `Image Recognition` plugin with [this link](https://imjoy.io/#/app?plugin=oeway/ImJoy-Plugins:Image%20Recognition&workspace=getting-started).
Clicking the link will open the ImJoy Web App and show a dialog to confirm the
installation of the plugin. Once installed, you can launch the plugin by clicking
the button `Image Recognition` in the plugin menu on the left. The demo plugin
will run a trained deep neural network model (MobileNet) to perform image
classification (e.g. identifying an elephant in an image).

This plugin uses your browser as its computational backend, so all
computation is done locally, no data will be sent to a remote server.

Besides running plugins in the browser, ImJoy provides the flexibility to keep
the GUI locally in your browser, and perform computational tasks with Python.
These computations can be performed on your computer utilising the full power
of the local GPU/CPU. The computational backend can also be launched on remote servers
including cloud servers on Amazon, Google Compute, or an institutional computing cluster.

## ImJoy architecture
By design, ImJoy itself provides very minimal task specific functionality.
It provides a flexible plugin interface to support plugins to extend the user
interface and perform computational tasks. Plugins can be designed to perform
simple tasks such as reading tif file, or more complex tasks such as training
a deep learning model for image segmentation.

Imjoy consists of **three parts**, each part can be extended with plugins:

1. **Web User Interface**. ImJoy is a web application. This means that using ImJoy is as easy as opening a web page from [ImJoy.io](https://imjoy.io/#/app). With ubiquitousness of the web, ImJoy provides unified user experience with browsers running on different operating systems, including mobile devices. The user can install plugins, and use them from the web interface. Besides a easy-to-use minimal interface, plugins can create their own window to create rich and interactive web interface by making use of the full power of the entire HTML/CSS/JS frameworks. For example, with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), one can easily provide powerful interactive charts or 3D visualisation plugins. For developers, the web interface is also used for writing and testing code. A stand-alone desktop application (desktopApp) is also provided.

1. **Web Computational Backend**. Computational tasks can be execution directly in the web browsers. Browsers are highly optimised and  JavaScript engines such as Google Chrome V8 and Firefox Quantum can be used to perform computational tasks. The performance of JavaScript Engines are close or even better than native languages such as Java and Python ([Benchmarks](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/node-python3.html)). With HTML5/WebGL, browser can access to GPUs, allowing transparent GPU computing with libraries such as [Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/). With a new web standard called [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), software/libraries written in high-level languages like C/C++/Rust can be ported to run in the browser. ImJoy uses ["Pyodide"](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) to run Python plugins directly in the browser. The advantage of using the web computational backend is it requires almost zero setup and can run on mobile devices. Importantly, browser provides a unified, secured and sandboxed environment with maximised security and stability.

1. **Native Computational Backend**. This is supported with the installation of an additional Python module called ["ImJoy Plugin Engine"](https://github.com/oeway/ImJoy-Engine). This allows to access the entire Python ecosystem which covers most of the scientific computing applications. With [Conda](https://conda.io), ImJoy plugin engine handles the requirements of plugins automatically and provide isolate processes and virtual environments for different Python plugins. It provides maximum flexibility and has full access to the file system, GPU and other local or remote resources. The plugin engine can be launched either on the local machine, or remotely on a cloud server or a cluster to perform computationally intensive tasks, e.g. with institutional computing cluster, Amazon Cloud, or Google Compute.
